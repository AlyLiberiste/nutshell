NutShell

OVERVIEW

This is a implementation of a shell for the discipline of [Operating Systems II][SOII]. It was taken in the course of Computer Science (ICMC - USP).

DISTRIBUTION AND USE

Users can find a distribution in the tab releases.

Run NutShell with:

  $ cd nutshell
  $ cd shell
  $ ./nutshell
NutShell can execute external commands like ls and clear and the following internal commands:

cd
exit
NutShell will also redirect input and output (NutShell's parser will handle the right order and whitespaces) and use pipe to run multiple programs at the same time.

BUILD AND INSTALL

For developers and builders follow the steps below.

Clone NutShell repository:

  $ git clone https://github.com/SOII-2016/nutshell.git
NutShell development environment rely on the GNU Build system (Autotools). Developers may be able to bootstrap the project by issuing:

  $ cd nutshell
  $ ./autogen.sh
The provided autogen.sh script should execute autoconf, automake, libtool and related programs in the right order.

Builders should be able to run:

 $ ./configure --prefix=<somepath>
 $ make
 $ make install
Builders should also be able to create distribution archives:

 $ make dist
The distributed files should contain all the files needed for building NutShell at the builder's environment, without the need of Autotools.
